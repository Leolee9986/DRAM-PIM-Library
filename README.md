# DRAM-PIM-Library

I'm currently a graduate student from the School of Integrated Circuits at Tsinghua University. My research interests lie primarily in Processing-In-Memory (PIM) architecture. Here is my personal selection of papers that focus on the study of DRAM-PIM, along with some reading notes.
